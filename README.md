# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy-dev`

Run this command to deploy your code to the live site. To add your credentials to the AWS CLI install the VSCode extension "AWS CLI Configure". Once this is installed login into your aws account, head to "Command line or programmatic access", and copy the AWS credentials file (Short-term credentials). Add these credentials to the AWS CLI credential file in vscode with "CMD + shift + p"(mac) or "CTRL + shift + p"(windows). Be sure to save the file. 

Now update the script, add your profile name, found in the square brackets at the top of your credential file.

Example of the final script:     

"deploy-dev": "aws s3 sync build/ s3://contacts.communitydayaccelerator.com --cache-control max-age=86400 --profile 1234567_ThisIsMy_DeveloperUserAccess --region us-east-2"


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
